# Sentiment-Analysis
An combination of ML and DL models to find out sentiment of a tweet in 2 fields - 1. Spectrum of Positive to Negative and 2. Sarcastic or Not.

This methodology combines deep learning and traditional machine learning for Twitter sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection. Tweets are preprocessed with cleaning and tokenization. A Bidirectional LSTM model handles sentiment analysis, while a CNN detects sarcasm. Features from these models are combined with TF-IDF vectors and input into machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost). An ensemble Voting Classifier aggregates predictions, enhancing accuracy and reducing overfitting through cross-validation and regularization techniques. The methodology's comprehensive design ensures robust performance and generalization to new, unseen data, making it well-suited for real-world applications in sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection on social media platforms.
